   <h3>Childhood and Upbringing</h3>
   <p>How we learn to cope with angry feelings is often influenced by our upbringing. </p>
   <p>Many people are given messages about anger as children. These messages may make </p>
   <p>it harder to manage anger as an adult. For example:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>You may have grown up thinking that it's always okay to act out your anger aggressively or violently. So you didn't learn how to understand and manage your angry feelings. This could mean you have angry outbursts whenever you don't like the way someone is behaving. Or whenever you're in a situation you don't like.</li>
    <li>You may have been brought up to believe that you shouldn't complain. You may have been punished for expressing anger as a child. This could mean that you tend to suppress your anger. If you don't feel you can release your anger in a healthy way, it can become a long-term problem. If you're not comfortable with new situations, your reaction to them might be out of place or ill-fitting. Or you might turn this anger inwards on yourself.</li>
    <li>You may have witnessed your parents' or other adults' anger when it was out of control. And learned to think of anger as something that is always destructive and terrifying. This could mean that you now feel afraid of your own anger. And you don't feel safe expressing your feelings when something makes you angry. Those feelings might then surface at another unconnected time. This may feel hard to explain.</li>
