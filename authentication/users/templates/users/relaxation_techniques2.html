   <h3>Relaxation Techniques</h3>
   <p>Anger, though uncomfortable, can sometimes spur us to address problems in relationships or work. But unchecked, it can lead to unhappiness, mental health issues, and harmful behaviors like aggression or abuse, damaging our social connections and well-being.</p>

        <p class="steps"><b>Recognize your triggers.</b> Usually, people get angry about specific things over and over again. Spend some time thinking about what makes you angry. Make an effort to avoid or deal with those things, if possible. For example, this might involve shutting the door to your child’s room when they don’t clean it instead of getting angry about the mess. Or it could mean using public transportation instead of driving to work if you’re easily angered by traffic.</p>
        <p class="steps"><b>Stop and listen.</b> When you’re in an angry argument, you might find yourself jumping to conclusions and saying things that are unkind. Making an effort to stop and listen to the other person in the conversation before reacting can help your anger drop and allow you to better respond and resolve the situation. Think carefully before replying. Tell them you need to take a step away if you feel you need to cool down before you continue the conversation.</p>
        <p class="steps"><b>Change your thinking.</b> Anger can make you feel like things are worse than they really are. Reduce your anger by replacing negative thoughts with more realistic ones. You can do this by avoiding extreme words, such as “never” or “always,” when you think. Other good strategies include keeping a balanced view of the world and turning your angry demands into requests instead.
        <p class="steps"><b>Avoid dwelling on the same things.</b> You may rehash the same situation that made you upset over and over again, even if the problem is resolved. This is called dwelling or ruminating. Dwelling allows anger to last and could cause further arguments or other issues. Try to move past the thing that caused your anger. Instead, try to take a look at the positive parts of the person or situation that made you upset.</p>
        <p class="steps"><b>Know your body.</b> When you get angry, your body tends to get very excited. Your heart rate, blood pressure, breathing speed, and body temperature may increase. Your body also releases certain stress hormones that put your body on high alert. Pay attention to your body when you’re angry. Learn your body’s anger warning signs. Next time you feel these warnings, you can step away from the situation or try a relaxation technique.</p>
